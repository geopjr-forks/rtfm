## Installation

Dependencies:

- [Crystal compiler](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal).
- [Shards dependency manager](https://github.com/crystal-lang/shards).
- [SQLite3](https://sqlite.org/index.html).
- [GTK4](https://www.gtk.org/)
- [Webkit2-5.0](https://webkitgtk.org/) (a.k.a. WebKit2 for GTK4)
- [GObject-introspection](https://gi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) packages for all GTK related dependencies.

There are no packages for any distro yet.

```
$ shards install
$ ./bin/gi-crystal
$ make
$ make install
```

Then you need to run some commands to let Gnome Shell update the application cache and start show Rtfm, but
if you don't remember these commands, just reinstall some Gnome application like gnome-calculator and it's done üòÖÔ∏è.

You can uninstall it later with:

```
$ make uninstall
```
